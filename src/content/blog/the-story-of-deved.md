The story of DeveD began in 2017 as a spark of inspiration among young IT enthusiasts seeking to create a space for knowledge-sharing and collaboration in the local tech community. The initial concept took the form of BeerJS Скопје, a local branch of the international BeerJS meetups where web development and JavaScript aficionados gathered to share their insights, ideas, and experiences in a relaxed atmosphere.

As the community grew, so did our ambitions. BeerJS Скопје quickly gained momentum and evolved into DeveD, an organization dedicated to empowering the local IT industry through events, workshops, and educational resources. With a focus on fostering collaboration, DeveD has since become an essential hub for IT companies, professionals, students, and enthusiasts.

Our journey has been filled with exciting milestones, such as the launch of CodePub, our bi-weekly podcast that dives into the lives and careers of tech professionals. CodePub has allowed us to reach an even wider audience, inspiring countless developers to learn, grow, and connect with the tech community.

DeveD's success is built on the foundation of teamwork and a shared passion for technology. Our community-driven approach has enabled us to create a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals can thrive and drive innovation. As we continue to grow, we remain committed to our vision of a high-quality, open, and collaborative local IT industry where unity and a sense of community are valued above all else.

We invite you to join us on this exciting journey, as we work together to shape the future of IT and foster a vibrant, thriving tech community.
