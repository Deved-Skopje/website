As a concept, DeveD arose way back in 2017 to address the need for a well-organized space where the local IT community could engage in knowledge-sharing and collaboration in a more informal setting. It began with the creation of [BeerJS Skopje](https://beerjs.mk), a local branch of the international BeerJS meetup where web development and JavaScript aficionados gathered to share their insights, ideas, and experiences in a relaxed atmosphere.

It quickly gained momentum and grew into a local staple among the local IT community. As we grew, new challenges arose, requiring a more structured approach to meet the needs and demands of both the local community as well as the local IT industry. Thus, DeveD was born - an organization dedicated to empowering the local IT industry through events, workshops, and educational resources, with a focus on fostering collaboration.

Aiming to reach an even greater number of IT enthusiasts, professionals across multiple channels, we have since launched [CodePub](https://codepub.dev), a bi-weekly podcast that dives into the lives and careers of tech professionals. It has allowed us to share interesting insights and inspire our audience to learn, grow, and connect with the local IT community.
DeveD’s endeavors and success are built on the foundation of teamwork and a shared passion for technology. Our community-driven approach has enabled us to create a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals can thrive, learn, and innovate. We are committed to create a high-quality environment in which both the local IT community and local IT industry can grow and expand – as well as provide avenues of promotion on the global IT stage through meaningful international partnerships.

We invite you to join us on this exciting journey, as we work together to shape the future of IT and foster a vibrant, thriving tech community.
